# Whipstaff

## Introduction

**This is massively out of date - I'm in progress of sorting it out**

Whipstaff is a PoC library for designing a common UI library leveraging WPF, ReactiveUI and DHGMS Data Manager. It is written in C#

Whipstaff is a proof of concept around designing a common way of loading and handling a UI application (much like Job Helper is designed around batch processes). The concept is aimed towards enterprise development and reducing the amount of code reproduced whilst ensuring a reasonable amount of power and functionality in terms of group policy, system integrity checks, operating system versioning, etc.

As a concept it is aimed at leveraging:

* WPF
* .NET4
* ReactiveUI
* WPF NotifyIcon
* DHGMS Data Manager
* XUnit
* AvalonDock
* Multiple Monitors
* Group Policy and \ or Customer Policy Provider
* Support for features in Windows 8 (Desktop mode only) with graceful degradation to features of older operating systems where necessary
* Application Restart and Recovery
* System Integrity Checks to aid in Information Security
* Accessibility taking into account:
** Colour Blindness
** Dyslexia

This project is in an early stage so the design and \ or underlying libraries implementations may be volatile at points.
